=========================================

A company intends to build a :blue:`WasteService` for the *separate collection of waste*,  composed of a set of elements:

#. a service area (rectangular, flat) that includes:
  
   - an :blue:`INDOOR` port, to enter waste material
   - a :blue:`PlasticBox` container, devoted to store objects made of plastic, upto **MAXPB** kg of material.
   - a :blue:`GlassBox` container, devoted to store objects made of glass, upto **MAXGB** kg of material.

   The service area is free from internal obstacles, as shown in the following picture:

      :align: center
      :width: 60%

#. a DDR robot working as a :blue:`transport trolley`, that is intially situated in its :blue:`HOME` location. 
   The transport trolley has  the form of a square of side length **RD**.

   The `transport trolley` is used to performa a :blue:`deposit action` that consists in the following phases:
   
   #.  pick up a waste-load from a :blue:`Waste truck` located on the `INDOOR`
   #.  go from the `INDOOR` to the proper waste container
   #.  deposit the waste-load in the container 

   .. A map of the service area, represented as a grid of squares of side length RD , is available in the file serviceAreaMap (.txt, .bin):
   .. The proper scene for the WEnv is reported in: serviceAreaConfig.js

#. a :blue:`Service-manager` (an human being) which supervises the state of the service-area by using a 
   :blue:`WasteServiceStatusGUI`. 

#. a :blue:`Sonar` and a :blue:`Led` connected to a RaspnerryPi. The `Led` is used as a *warning devices*, 
   according to the following scheme:

   - the `Led` is **off** when the  `transport trolley` is at `HOME`
   - the `Led` **blinks** while the `transport trolley` is moving 
   - the `Led` is **on** when `transport trolley` is stopped.

   The `Sonar` is used as an 'alarm device': when it measures a distance less that a prefixed value **DLIMT**,
   the `transport trolley` must be stopped. 
   It will be resumed when `Sonar` detects again a distance higher than  **DLIMT**.

The main goal of the :blue:`WasteService` software is to allow a :blue:`Waste truck` to deposit its load of 
**TruckLoad** kg plastic or glass in the proper container.

The global story can be described as follows:

#. The `Waste truck` driver approaches the `INDOOR` and sends (using a smart device) a request to store the load, 
   by specifyng the `type of  the material` (plastic or glass) and its `TruckLoad`.
#. The `WasteService` sends the answer *loadaccept* if the final content of proper container will not surpass the 
   maximum value allowed (*MAXPB* or *MAXGB*). Otherwise, it sends the answer *loadrejecetd* and the  `Waste truck`
   leaves the `INDOOR` area.
#. When the load is accepted, the `transport trolley` reaches the `INDOOR`, picks up the material, goes to the 
   proper container and settles the material. During this activity, the `WasteService` **blinks** the `Led` 
#. When the deposit action is terminated, the `transport trolley`  excutes another deposit command (if any) 
   or returns to its `HOME`.


The `WasteService` must create a :blue:`WasteServiceStatusGUI` that shows to the *Service-manager*:

- the current state of the `transport trolley` and it position in the room
- the current weigth of the material stored in the two waste-containers
- the current state of the `Led`
