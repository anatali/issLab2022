RobotExplorer
=================================

The robot:

-  works as an explorer of the room. Starting from its HOME, the goal is to create a map of the room 
   that records the position of the fixed obstacles;
-  returns immediately to the HOME as soon as it finds an obstacle;
-  stops for a while (e.g. 2 seconds), when it 'feels' that the sonar has detected its presence;
